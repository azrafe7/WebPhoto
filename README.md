# WebPhoto
Customized [Jpeg Camera](https://github.com/amw/jpeg_camera) demo.

What it does:

 - not much, but...
 - can apply some simple image filters to your webcam snapshots (using [CamanJS](http://camanjs.com/))
 - can save the resulting image as jpeg or png
 - can be easily run locally (without an internet connection - f.e. with python or mongoose)

### Why?
I needed a minimal photo booth app that could also apply some simple filters/effects, and save the results locally.

This thing tries to do exactly that.

### Something isn't working!? o.O
